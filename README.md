LaTeX equations
===============

Cheap & cheerful LaTeX equation editor.

I needed an easy, cross-platform way to create math equations
for presentation slides. At the moment
there is no functionality to export to an image, so one needs
a separate screenshot app with *grab area* functionality. Your OS probably
has you covered.

Clone this repo with `git clone --recursive`.

The heavy lifting is done by the following dependencies. Hat tip!

* equations are rendered via [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/)
* colorpicker provided by [spectrum](https://github.com/bgrins/spectrum)
