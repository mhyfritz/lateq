LaTeX equations
===============

Cheap & cheerful LaTeX equation editor.

I needed an easy, cross-platform way to create math equations
for presentation slides. At the moment
there is no functionality to export to an image, so one needs
a separate screenshot app with *grab area* functionality. Your OS probably
has you covered.

The heavy lifting is done by [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/). Hat tip!
